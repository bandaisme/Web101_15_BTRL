    <div style="width: 50%; margin: auto"><p>A sprawling metropolis, Mexico City invites comparisons to other cities for its scale and its importance as a
    continental hub. Walk through the Centro Historico at night, and you’ll find it has the up-all-night energy and culinary
    scene of any other global capital. But CDMX (Ciudad de México) is more than just urban bustle—it’s a collision of
    contemporary life with ancient history dating back to the Aztecs. That history echoes through everything here, from
    street food to music to vivid murals, giving a deeper resonance to daily life.</p></div>
